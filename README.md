# Project Overview

These projects are all from the [Learn How to Code (v2) with Google's Golang Programming Languauge](https://greatercommons.com/learn/509818362553958) course. While I have already taken version one of this course, I want to ramp up my skills in Go and really hone them in order to fully understand the content presened in the Web Dev w/Go course. 

## Project Goal

To complete version 2.0 of this course, and I will summarize what I've learned each day at the end of my session along with completing all of the project exercises.

## Project Exercises

I will complete the project exercises after every section and review what I've learned up to this point.

## Project Summary

I summarize what I've learned each day I work on the course, a la the #100DaysOfCode style - format is below.
