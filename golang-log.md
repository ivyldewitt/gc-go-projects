# Course Reflections
*************************************

Review & reflections from each day of learning to code.

**D1: Monday, July 31st, 2017**

**What did I learn today?**:

Today, I started v2 of the Learn How to Code course. So far, I've covered the following topics:

* Learning the basics of the Go playground and its uses for debugging/sharing code.
* Review of the basics of a Go program - including package main, func main, how imported packages work, and the distinction of visible/non-visible packages. 
* A quick recap of Go Fmt, and go's formatting rules.
* How we use the short declaration operator, and some key terms such as expression, statement, operand and operator.
* The var keyword, which we can use to declare variables at the package level, instead of within a specific function's scope.
* Assigning values with the var keyword, and how we can declare a value on the same statement as var, but we can't declare ```var x int``` and then ```x = 10```.
* Types - Go is statically typed, not dynamic like JS/Python. That means when you declare a type as an int, string, etc. that's exactly what it is and it can't be changed. I also reviewed primitive data types (ints, floats) vs composite types (structs, arrays, etc).

**How does this build on from yesterday?**:
It doesn't! Technically this is my first day. Though I did provide an explantation to someone else yesterday. I added that as a separate answer in my 01 folder. 

That was a lot of fun. I won't always know the answer, but it's nice when I do!

**Key Takeways & Points to Review**:
* Types - primitive vs composite
* Structure of a Go program - package main, func main, exported/non-exported functions, etc.
* Variable declarations - with var and :=

**Any Reflections?**:
Not anything of note just yet - it's weird at the moment to take the same course I took before so soon, but I feel like I have a much better plan on how to go about it so I'm excited for that. That enough is a great motivator.


**D2: Tuesday, August 1st, 2017**

**What did I learn today?**:

Second day of v2 of the Learn How to Code course. So far I've completed Section 2 on variables, values, and type and learned the following topics:

* How Go implements the "zero value" across its various types.
* The concepts of static typed languages - i.e. that a type can't be converted from one format to another.
* The basics of how packages work by review the "fmt" package - including documentation, exported functions and types.
* Also, how string formatting works with "%T", "%v".
* Creating types - aka how we can alias types with type declarations. Typically done wih structs as a general rule of thumb.
* Type conversions - how to convert one type to another type. Including converting a declared type to its underlying type.

**How does this build on from yesterday?**:
Yesterday I spent most of my time reviewing/learning about the basics of variables - including the short declaration operator, var, the basic structure of a Go program, and a short intro to types. All in all nothing new, but definitely a lot of useful info to know. 

**Key Takeways & Points to Review**:
* Types - declarations and conversion
* Structure of packages - fmt - Sprint familt, Print family, Fprint family.
* Zero values

**Any Reflections?**:
Mostly more review - now onto the exercises!
